# Online version now available - This is now deprecated!
check out https://makeplace-export.thebwt.com - It's only got teamcraft stuff on it, but I'm pretty sure that's all ya'll used anyways.
No more learning to use python on the console!

# Makeplace list exporter
Howdy! 
This tool is for exporting Makeplace savefiles as lists into external tools. Right now it can create a garlandtools group and a teamcraft list.

I think this micro-project is done, and will probably try to spin something web based up soon that basically meets this functionality without need a user to have python handy.

 - Thanks to SubaruYashiro in discord for the garlandtools logic!
 - this script was written and tested in python 3.10.2
